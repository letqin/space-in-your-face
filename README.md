# Space In Your Face

We have designed a space themed web page with a couple of very interesting APIs. The first uses the two-line element (TLE) set to calculate the current and future location of the ISS.

## APIs used

The [Where the ISS at API](https://wheretheiss.at/)...

***

[APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) is NASA's picture of the day API which is used to display a new picture every day from their photo library. Photos from the [Curiosity rover](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210914.html), [nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210818.html), and some particularly beautiful [astronomical phenomenon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210901.html) are some of the many things they have included. The website can also be visited to see the full library of pictures, of which there are thousands.

## The Page Itself

In the Quick Links section, we have included a link to a few space related websites. From top to bottom we have [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/), [Virgin Galactic](http://www.virgingalactic.com/), and of course the [ISS live stream](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/iss_ustream.html). The information on these websites can (and should) be explored.
